California is the No. 1 travel destination in the country. 

In 2022, travel and tourism expenditures generated a projected $134.4 billion in revenue for California businesses. The money spent by travelers directly supported jobs for 1.1 million Californians and generated $11.9 billion in state and local tax revenues. In FY21/22, Visit California generated $38.2 billion in incremental ad spending — travel dollars that would not have been spent in California otherwise.

The HKTB is headquartered in Hong Kong. Currently it has a worldwide network of 15 offices and has representatives in six different markets.

The six objectives of the HKTB, as defined under the HKTB Ordinance, are to: ​
1) Endeavour to increase the contribution of tourism to Hong Kong;​
2) Promote Hong Kong globally as a leading international city in Asia and a world-class tourist destination;​
3) Promote the improvement of facilities for visitors;​
4) Support the Government in promoting to the community the importance of tourism;​
5) Support, as appropriate, the activities of persons providing services for visitors to Hong Kong; and​
6) Make recommendations to and advise the Chief Executive (of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) in relation to any measures which may be taken to further any of the foregoing matters.​

In 2008 the HKTB established Meetings & Exhibitions Hong Kong (MEHK) to continue strengthening Hong Kong's position as the premier destination for Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions (MICE) in Asia Pacific.

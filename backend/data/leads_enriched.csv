Ive found myself saying the same thing in a lot of different settings recently: determining what is true and deciding what to do are different bodies of work. There is no obligation to only consider explanations for what you see that map cleanly to the levers you (or anyone) knows how to pull. Knowing whatis true has to come first, so you can figure out what (if anything) to do.   Or to put it the other way around, adjusting  what you know to conform to the levers someone might be able to pull right now might be more comfortable in the short term, but if you move away from the best understanding of a problem, you rob the organization of the chance to build the new levers that are needed to solve problems in the best possible way.",2025/11/19 0:51,https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mattstolbach_what-is-true-comes-before-what-to-do-activity-7396696569426796545-Y3IW?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAAGLjps8BN_b4wMRSKbOMnqrTozICxI13838,"I'm finally reading The Power Broker (listening to it, actually), and this line struck me: ""When there is no time for the thinking required for original creation, the tendency is to repeat what has been successful in the past.""

Creativity is hard to measure, but creative output is vital: it's how problems are solved, opportunities are born, and in my experience it's part of how teams are inspired and come to believe in what they are capable of.  And of course, creative output can be improved and accelerated in some ways, and some of those ways might be similar to how any output can be improved and accelerated.

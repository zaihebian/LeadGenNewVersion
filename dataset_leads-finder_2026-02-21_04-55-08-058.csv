In turn, they have made us into one of the most successful travel companies in the UK – not a big faceless behemoth, but a caring, honest, and real travel company, that punches well above its weight.

Our customers benefit from this in many ways – not only are they being looked after by highly experienced people – they are speaking to people who love what they do. This is why 98% of our customers rate us as ‘Excellent' on Trust Pilot – delivering a great service and customer focus is who we are. 

We started our Concierge brand in 2019. With some of our most experienced travel managers wanting to achieve a better work life balance – we didn't want to lose them, and they didn't want to leave – DialAFlight Concierge was born.
Our systems were developed in-house over many years, they are cutting edge, and take away many of the manual aspects of being a successful travel manager. Ticketing, airline queues, and time change alerts to name but a few, are all automated. Meaning that our Concierges are self-sufficient and avoid spending their lives doing administration. We also have an in-house 24/7 team to look after our customers outside of office hours, as well as providing help to our Concierges.

We opened up our Travel franchise to other like-minded travel experts and have created a close network of people who not only appreciate how cutting edge our systems are, but know how valuable the level of care and support that we offer really is. Our Concierges are there for each other, and are building a fantastic community. We want to work with people who are ready to start their journey to become a travel business in their own right.

Longleat Forest in Wiltshire,

This year brought further accolade as we were recognised as the travel industry's Best Agency to Work For.

Established by John Hays in 1980, John and Irene Hays became ‘Heroes of the high street' in 2019, when Hays Travel acquired the entire portfolio of former Thomas Cook shops, providing re-employment opportunities to the 2,500 staff who were made redundant. Hays Travel has continued to grow and now has over 490 branches across the UK and employs 4,500 people.
As a family-owned independent agency, what sets Hays Travel apart is our friendly and professional colleagues; we value our people, our customers and the communities where we operate.

Being independent, we can offer our customers impartial advice and an extensive range of travel opportunities from hundreds of suppliers, whether in our branches, via our contact centre, through our network of homeworkers, or via our franchisees and independence group members.
Throughout its history, Hays Travel colleagues have worked hard to help the communities where we operate. Each year every one of our branches receives £500 to invest in their local community. The Hays Travel Foundation, established in 2015, works with a wide range of organisations and charities to help young people achieve and be the best that they can be in their health, sport, the arts, and education.

We fell in love with creating the best experience in the skies for our customers, and they fell in love with us right back.

Since then we've become Britain's second largest carrier, with non-stop transatlantic routes including New York, Orlando, the Caribbean, Delhi and Johannesburg. And thanks to our hugely successful joint venture with Delta, Air France and KLM, we can seamlessly connect our customers to over 350 cities across North America, Europe and the UK. 

Today, we want to empower everyone to take on the world. The customers we proudly fly and our people who go the extra mile. As we embark on a brand spanking new era of travel, it gives us more opportunities to do things differently and lead the way with fresh ideas. This means becoming more sustainable for our planet and our destinations, and working hard to make travel open to everyone, no matter who you are, who you love or where you go. 

And of course never, ever, forgetting the small stuff - like the clink of champagne glasses on a special occasion or a cheeky cream tea at 30,000 feet.","2370671000","2.4B","international airline, airlines & aviation, book flights, flight deals, last minute flights, premium flights, economy flights, upper class flights, direct flights, latin america, caribbean destinations, north america flights, middle east flights, europe destinations, travel insurance, baggage allowance, premium experience, in-flight entertainment, dining options, flying club, earn points, spend points, reward seats, travel partners, car hire, airport lounges, flight management, check-in process, flight status, manage booking, holiday deals, all inclusive holidays, family holidays, luxury travel, travel advice, visas & entry requirements, special assistance, customer commitment, boarding priority, cabin crew services, eco-friendly travel, sustainable aviation, skyteam alliance, virgin red, business travel solutions, holidays packages, airport guides, customer support, travel news, covid-19 travel policy, refundable tickets, data insights, british airline, customer service, cabin classes, economy, premium, upper class, inflight entertainment, food & drink, chauffeur transfers, cargo services, sustainability, net-zero carbon emissions, innovative travel experiences, diverse audience, corporate travelers, unique experiences, partnerships, frequent-flyer program, community initiatives, aviation industry, travel & tourism, global reach, competitive analysis, customer satisfaction, inclusivity, adventure, mavericks, business travel, premium services, airline partnerships, travel extras, eco-friendly initiatives, customer reviews, brand loyalty, travel packages, virgin holidays, airlines/aviation, aviation & aerospace, leisure, travel & tourism, environmental services, renewables & environment, airlines, bars, hotels & travel, nightlife, transportation","at internet, adara, adobe cq, adobe marketing cloud, adobe media optimizer, akamai, amadesa, amazon aws, amazon cloudfront, amazon ses, basis, bing ads, bootstrap framework, cedexis radar, cloudinary, disqus, doubleclick, doubleclick conversion, ensighten, exacttarget, facebook custom audiences, facebook login (connect), facebook widget, google adsense, google adwords conversion, google analytics, google analytics ecommerce tracking, google dynamic remarketing, google font api, google maps, google maps (non paid users), google maps (paid users), google play, google tag manager, heroku, hotjar, jquery 1.11.1, microsoft office 365, mimecast, mobile friendly, multilingual, omniture (adobe), onetrust, outlook, paypal, react redux, remote, route 53, ruxit, soasta, sendgrid, shutterstock, tagman, tealeaf, typekit, vimeo, vuejs, wp engine, wordpress.org, youtube, zendesk, itunes","166809","1984","virginatlantic.com","+44 344 811 0000","Manor Royal","the office, manor royal, crawley, west sussex, united kingdom","England",,"United Kingdom","RH10 9NU"

We fell in love with creating the best experience in the skies for our customers, and they fell in love with us right back.

Since then we've become Britain's second largest carrier, with non-stop transatlantic routes including New York, Orlando, the Caribbean, Delhi and Johannesburg. And thanks to our hugely successful joint venture with Delta, Air France and KLM, we can seamlessly connect our customers to over 350 cities across North America, Europe and the UK. 

Today, we want to empower everyone to take on the world. The customers we proudly fly and our people who go the extra mile. As we embark on a brand spanking new era of travel, it gives us more opportunities to do things differently and lead the way with fresh ideas. This means becoming more sustainable for our planet and our destinations, and working hard to make travel open to everyone, no matter who you are, who you love or where you go.
